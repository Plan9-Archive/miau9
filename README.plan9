I build like so:

% ape/psh
# export CFLAGS="-D_C99_SNPRINTF_EXTENSION -D_BSD_EXTENSION -DHAVE_SOCK_OPTS -DHAVE_SNPRINTF -g"
# ./configure --disable-mkpasswd
[lots of junk]
# make
[this will compile some stuff and then bail out at the documentation step]
# cp misc/miaurc $home/lib/
[Now go and edit your miaurc to taste]
# cp src/miau $home/bin/386/

And then to run it:
# miau -f -d $home/lib

You can then connect to localhost:4096 by default, with whatever password you chose in the miaurc.

If, like me, you want the quicklog functionality, you may want to hand-edit config.h to enable the appropriate defines. Passing options to configure doesn't seem to have much effect, so I have been setting CFLAGS or editing config.h as desired.

Email john at jfloren dot net if you need help.
